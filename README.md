# FUTURE_CS_02 - Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response

This repository documents a cybersecurity intern-led SOC analysis performed on sample log data using **Elastic Stack (Kibana, Elasticsearch, Logstash)**. The analysis focuses on **threat detection, incident response, and remediation**, aligned with OWASP Top 10.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Elastic Stack** (Kibana, Elasticsearch, Logstash) running on **Windows via Opera Browser**  
- **Sample Log Files**  

---

## üìä Key Features
- Real-time log analysis via **Kibana Discover**  
- Detection of malware (**Trojan, Rootkit, Spyware, Worm, Ransomware**)  
- Login failure tracking and brute-force detection  
- Connection attempt monitoring  
- Alert severity classification

## üß† Recommendations
1. **Isolate infected hosts** to prevent lateral movement  
2. **Trigger endpoint malware scans** on affected machines  
3. **Audit user credentials** and enforce password resets if needed  
4. **Monitor flagged IP ranges** for unusual connection attempts  
5. **Review access logs** for any suspicious file access  

---

## üì¨ Notification Plan
- Alert **SOC Lead** immediately  
- Share the report with **IT Security Manager**  
- Prepare **containment and remediation instructions** for affected endpoints
